# Analyzing-Customer-Behavior-Based-on-Transaction-Data

Project Description:

This project focuses on understanding and analyzing customer behavior using transactional data. The objective is to perform a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to derive valuable insights into customer preferences, purchasing patterns, and overall behavior. These insights are visualized using interactive dashboards in Power BI to assist businesses in making data-driven decisions.

Project Goals:

Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Importing the Dataset: Imported transactional data from various sources.
Data Cleaning: Checked for and handled missing values, removed duplicate rows to ensure data integrity.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Summary Statistics: Calculated summary statistics to understand the central tendencies and distributions of numerical columns.
Data Visualization: Visualized numerical columns using various plots to identify trends and patterns.
Correlation Analysis: Analyzed the correlation between Quantity (QTY) and Value to understand their relationship.
Pearson Correlation Coefficient: Calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient to quantify the linear relationship between QTY and Value.
Categorical Data Analysis:

Sales by Category: Plotted total sales quantity and total sales value by category. Identified and focused on the top N categories based on sales metrics.
Brand Analysis: Grouped data by brand and summed up sales quantity and value to identify key trends and performance metrics.
Company/Manufacturer Analysis: Similar grouping and summation for companies/manufacturers to uncover insights at the company level.
Store Analysis:

Sales by Store: Grouped data by store code and summed up sales quantity and value. Plotted total sales value by store to identify high-performing and underperforming stores.
RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary):

Calculating RFM Values: Calculated recency, frequency, and monetary values for each customer to understand customer behavior and segment them based on these metrics.
Sales Analysis: Aggregated sales data by month to identify seasonal trends and patterns.
Association Analysis:

Transaction Records: Created transactional records for association rule mining.
Top Associations: Sorted and displayed top associations to understand common purchase patterns.
Export and Visualization:

Exporting Results: Exported RFM analysis results to CSV files using Python.
Power BI Dashboards: Used the original dataset and exported datasets in Power BI to create comprehensive visualizations and interactive dashboards.
Technologies and Tools:

Python: For data cleaning, preprocessing, analysis, and exporting results (using libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn).
Power BI: For creating interactive visualizations and dashboards to present findings effectively.
Outcome:
The project delivered a detailed analysis report and interactive dashboards that provide a comprehensive understanding of customer behavior. The insights derived from this analysis help businesses optimize their marketing strategies, improve customer engagement, and make informed decisions to enhance overall business performance.
